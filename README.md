=====================

Starter code and project structure for making web projects using Spring MVC, JSP, IDEA, gradle, Spring Data JPA

Why does this exist?
--------------------

I found that I kept having to set up the same files over and over whenever I made a new project. Of course, these are just a start and probably you'll want to rip out the Spring Data JPA in favor of some service-oriented thing when you get a chance, but it's always nice to get quick start on things.
